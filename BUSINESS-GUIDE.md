# Business Observability Forge

### Turn Customer Journeys Into Business Intelligence — Powered by Dynatrace

> **Model any customer journey. Simulate real traffic at scale. Connect every technical failure to its revenue impact. Prove resilience with AI-powered chaos engineering and self-healing — all inside Dynatrace.**

---

### The Pitch

> *"What if you could take any customer's real business journey — their exact checkout flow, their claims process, their patient care pathway — model it in minutes, spin up real instrumented microservices, and show them exactly what happens when something breaks? Not a slide deck. Not a theoretical scenario. A live, running simulation inside Dynatrace where they can watch revenue drop, watch Davis AI detect it, and watch an AI agent fix it — all in real time."*

> *That's the Business Observability Forge.*

---

### Why It Wins Deals

🎯 **It's not a demo — it's their business, running live in Dynatrace.** Every journey you build mirrors the customer's actual operations. When they see *their* checkout flow fail and *their* revenue number drop, the conversation changes from "why do we need observability?" to "how fast can we deploy this?"

💰 **It quantifies the cost of downtime in their language.** Not "99.9% uptime" — but "$127,000/hour in blocked patient care revenue" or "340 abandoned loan applications per hour." That's the number that gets budget approved.

🤖 **It proves AI isn't a buzzword.** Chaos injection → Davis AI detection → autonomous remediation → organizational learning. Four steps, 30 seconds, zero human intervention. That's the future of IT operations, and you can show it live.

⚡ **It compresses months of proof-of-value into minutes.** Traditional POCs take weeks of integration work. The Forge generates a full multi-service environment with realistic traffic, business events, and Dynatrace telemetry — ready to demo — in under 30 minutes.

🏆 **It's the most compelling business observability story in the market.** No other platform can go from "describe your customer journey" to "here's your revenue impact dashboard with AI-powered self-healing" in a single session.

## The Problem: You Can't Protect Revenue You Can't See

Every business runs on customer journeys — a patient accessing care, a customer signing up for broadband, an investor opening an account. These journeys span multiple systems, teams, and technologies.

When something breaks in one of those systems, the business impact is invisible:

- **IT sees:** "Service X has a 500 error rate of 12%"
- **The business sees:** "Revenue is down 8% this quarter and we don't know why"

There's a gap between what technology teams monitor and what the business actually cares about. Traditional observability tells you *what broke*. Business observability tells you *what it cost you*.

---

## What the Business Observability Forge Does

The Forge bridges that gap. It's a platform that:

1. **Models your real customer journeys** — from first click to final transaction
2. **Generates realistic business traffic** — so you can see what observability looks like at scale
3. **Connects technical failures to business outcomes** — every error has a revenue number attached
4. **Demonstrates AI-powered resilience** — chaos injection, automatic detection, and self-healing

It runs inside **Dynatrace** — the same platform your teams already use for monitoring — so there's nothing new to learn, no new tool to adopt.

---

## Why Should You Care?

### 1. See Revenue Impact in Real Time

Every journey step carries business metadata: transaction value, customer lifetime value, conversion probability, churn risk. When a service fails, you don't just see a red dot on a topology map — you see:

> "The TriageAndAssessment service is failing at 80%. This is blocking 340 patient journeys per hour with an estimated impact of $127,000 in delayed care revenue."

That's the conversation your CTO needs to have with your CFO.

### 2. Prove the Value of Observability to the Board

The hardest part of selling observability internally is showing ROI. The Forge gives you a live, working demo that shows:

- **Before chaos:** All journeys completing, revenue flowing, KPIs green
- **During chaos:** One service fails → journeys break → revenue drops → Davis AI detects it
- **After remediation:** AI agent fixes the issue → journeys recover → revenue resumes

That's a 3-minute story that justifies a multi-year platform investment.

### 3. De-Risk Digital Transformation

Every business is digitizing customer journeys. The Forge lets you model those journeys *before* they're built, see what happens when things go wrong, and prove that your observability platform will catch it.

Industries already modeled:

| Industry | Example Journeys |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Healthcare** | Patient care access, clinical encounter, follow-up support |
| **Financial Services** | Account opening, ISA transfers, identity verification |
| **Banking** | Loan applications, fraud resolution |
| **Insurance** | Claims processing, policy purchase, renewal |
| **Retail** | Purchase, click & collect, loyalty signup |
| **Telecommunications** | Broadband signup, service support |
| **Media** | Bundle discovery, installation scheduling |
| **Manufacturing** | Vehicle assembly, logistics, quality gates |

### 4. Demonstrate AI-Powered Resilience

The Forge includes four AI agents that show what the future of IT operations looks like:

| Agent | What It Does | Business Value |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Nemesis** | Injects controlled failures into specific services | Proves your platform detects problems before customers do |
| **Fix-It** | Automatically diagnoses and fixes the problem | Shows mean-time-to-repair dropping from hours to seconds |
| **Librarian** | Remembers every incident and what worked | Demonstrates organizational learning — same problem never happens twice |
| **Dashboard** | Deploys executive dashboards with one click | Gives leadership real-time visibility without asking IT |

## The Demo Story

Here's how to walk a business audience through the Forge in 10 minutes:

### Act 1: "This Is Your Business" (2 minutes)

Open the Forge UI inside Dynatrace. Show the **Template Library** — 24 pre-built journeys across 8 industries.

> "Let's say you're a healthcare provider. Your patients go through a care journey: they register, get triaged and assessed, have a clinical consultation, receive treatment, and go through discharge and follow-up. That's 6 steps, each running on a different system."

Click a template. Services spin up. Auto-load begins generating traffic.

> "Each step is now a real microservice, instrumented by Dynatrace, generating real business events with real revenue data. We're simulating 30–60 patient journeys per minute."

### Act 2: "What Happens When Something Breaks" (3 minutes)

Open the **Chaos Control** page. Select the TriageAndAssessment service. Inject `enable_errors` at 80%.

> "Imagine your triage system starts failing. Maybe a database connection pool is exhausted, maybe a third-party integration is down. 80% of patients can't be assessed."

Switch to Dynatrace:
- **Services view** — the TriageAndAssessment service goes red
- **Business events** — journey completions drop
- **Problems** — Davis AI opens a problem, correlating the CUSTOM_DEPLOYMENT event with the error spike

> "Dynatrace didn't just detect an error. It correlated the root cause — our chaos injection event — with the business impact. It knows *which* journeys are affected and *what* the revenue impact is."

### Act 3: "AI Fixes It Before You Even Know" (3 minutes)

Open the **Fix-It Agent** page. Click "Run Diagnosis."

> "The Fix-It agent queries Dynatrace for the active problem, reads the logs, checks the topology, and figures out that the TriageAndAssessment service has artificially elevated error flags."

The agent proposes a fix: reset the feature flags. Click "Execute."

> "In 4 seconds, the agent diagnosed the issue, proposed a fix, executed it, verified the service recovered, and logged the entire incident to organizational memory. The Librarian agent now knows: 'When TriageAndAssessment has high error rates caused by feature flag overrides, the fix is to reset the flags.' Next time, it'll be even faster."

### Act 4: "The Executive View" (2 minutes)

Show the Dynatrace dashboard with:
- Journey completion rates by company
- Revenue impact over time
- Service health heatmap
- Chaos injection markers on the timeline

> "This is what your CTO sees. Not 'Service X is down.' Instead: 'Patient care journeys dropped 80% for 4 minutes, estimated revenue impact $8,400, automatically remediated by AI agent, root cause logged for future prevention.'"

---

## Key Differentiators

| Traditional Monitoring | Business Observability Forge |
|----------------------|------------------------------|
| "Service X is down" | "Patient triage is failing, blocking 340 journeys/hour" |
| Manual incident response | AI agent detects, diagnoses, and fixes in seconds |
| Siloed technical metrics | Business KPIs tied to every transaction |
| Dashboard built by hand over weeks | One-click AI-generated executive dashboards |
| No organizational memory | Every incident recorded, every fix learned |
| Static test data | Dynamic, realistic traffic across 8 industries |

---

## What This Means for Your Organization

### For the CTO
"I can show the board exactly how our observability investment protects revenue. Every dollar we spend on Dynatrace correlates to faster detection, faster resolution, and fewer customer-impacting incidents."

### For the VP of Engineering
"My teams get pre-built journey models for their verticals. They can prove chaos resilience before go-live, and the AI agents reduce toil by handling routine remediation automatically."

### For the Business Unit Leader
"I can see my customer journeys in real time. When something breaks, I know the revenue impact immediately — not in next month's report. And the AI fixes it before my customers notice."

### For the Dynatrace Champion
"This is the most compelling business observability demo I've ever seen. It turns a technical monitoring conversation into a business value conversation in 3 minutes."

## FAQ

**Q: Is this real data or synthetic?**
A: The services are real Node.js microservices instrumented by Dynatrace OneAgent. The business events, traces, and metrics are real — generated with realistic profiles, randomized timing, and actual HTTP calls between services. It's the same data shape your production systems would produce.

**Q: Can I tailor this to a specific customer's journey?**
A: Absolutely — and this is the real power. You're not limited to the 24 built-in templates. You can describe any customer's real-world flow in plain language, and the AI will generate the full journey configuration — every step, every substep, with appropriate business metadata. Alternatively, you can research the customer's publicly documented processes, import industry knowledge from any AI assistant (Copilot, Gemini, etc.), and use that as input. The result is a bespoke demo that mirrors *that customer's* exact business — not a generic vertical template.

**Q: Can I model my own customer journeys?**
A: Yes. Three ways: (1) Use AI-assisted generation — describe the journey and let the Forge build it. (2) Create manually through the UI with full control over steps, substeps, and business metadata. (3) Import a JSON journey definition for repeatable, shareable configurations.

**Q: Does this require Dynatrace?**
A: Yes — the Forge was built for Dynatrace. It leverages OneAgent instrumentation, Davis AI correlation, BizEvents, EdgeConnect tunneling, and AppEngine to deliver the full business observability experience. It's not a generic tool adapted to Dynatrace — it's a Dynatrace-native platform from the ground up.

**Q: How long does the demo take to set up?**
A: About 30 minutes for first-time setup. After that, launching a demo is one click from the Template Library — or a few minutes to generate a custom journey for a specific customer.

**Q: Can I use this for a customer demo?**
A: That's exactly what it's built for. Pick a matching industry template to get started fast, or generate a custom journey tailored to *their* specific business flow. Walk through the 10-minute demo story above and you'll have the most compelling business observability conversation they've ever seen. The fact that it mirrors their own journey — not some generic example — is what makes it land.
